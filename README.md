# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Exercise Details

Please create a user interface that allows a user to create and edit an inventory of books. You should use Typescript but any other libraries are at your discretion.
Your application should:
- Allow a user to add a new book to their inventory with a title, author, ISBN, and cover image
- Allow a user to search in their books by title
- Persist data across page reloads

Some of the things we'll be looking for on the submission are:
- Good usage of Typescript
- Good usage of React Hooks
- Safe use of Local Storage
- Clean Architecture

If there are parts where you would "normally" take a piece further please feel free to explain that with a code comment rather than chasing a rabbit hole. We don't want this assignment to take up more than **two hours** of your time. A great example of this would be a well-developed UI. While normally important for any web application, for this exercise it could add additional time for an area that won't explicitly be reviewed, or rather, not given as much priority as the four points above. Feel free however, to notate in a comment or in your submission email what you would "normally" do instead. 

Upon completion, please open up a forked PR to the original rpeo and if unable to do so, please email a link to the repo to email from our initial phone screen invitation.

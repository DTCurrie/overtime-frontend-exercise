# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Excercise Details

Please create a user interface that allows a user to create and edit an inventory of books. You should use Typescript but any other libraries are at your discretion.
Your application should:
- Allow a user to add a new book to their inventory with a title, author, ISBN, and cover image
- Allow a user to search in their books by title
- Persist data across page reloads

Some of the things we'll be looking for on the submission are:
- Good usage of Typescript
- Good usage of React Hooks
- Safe use of Local Storage
- Clean Architecture

If there are parts where you would "normally" take a piece further please feel free to explain that with a code comment rather than chasing a reabbit hole. We don't want this assignment to take up more than **two hours** of your time. A great example of this would be responsive design/UI. While normally important for any web application, making the application responsive could add additional time for an area that won't explicitly be reviewed, or rather, not given as much priority as the four points above. Feel free however, to notate in a comment or in your submission email what you would "normally" do instead. 

Upon completion, please remove the node_modules directory, zip up the whole folder, and rename it to your name. Next please upload to https://overtime.app.box.com/f/fd6e0b5384ce4c80b272c746366839cb and send us an email to let us know it's complete.
